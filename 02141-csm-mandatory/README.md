## Parse a GCL program with application.
- Have the GCL program in a file ending in ".gcl"
- Run the main function (The entrypoint marked with [\<EntryPoint>] attribute) in Program.fs
- Write file path to the GCL program.

## Visual AST
Parsing a GCL program will generate a file with the same name but with a ".ast" file extension. Copy the contents of the ".ast" file into the Data(editable) panel at http://jimblackler.net/treefun/.
