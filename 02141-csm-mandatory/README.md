## Files
- Parser.fsp : The parser file for fsyacc.exe
- Lexer.fsl : The lexer file for fslex.exe
- AST.fs : abstract syntax tree (type definition)
- Program.fs : The entry point of the application, also the program logic.
- ASTPrettyPrinter : A module for printing the AST in a format for external AST tool.
- Parser.fs, Lexer.fs, Parser.fsi : Autogenerated files from parser generator.
- buildpg.sh : A script file for building parser og lexer (used mostly for development)
- PGCompiler : Contains type definitions and compilation code for the program graph
- PGPrinter : Contains code to format program graph to string and graphiz format.

## Parse a GCL program with application.
- Have the GCL program in a file ending in ".gcl"
- Run the main function (The entrypoint marked with [\<EntryPoint>] attribute) in Program.fs
- Specify if program graph should be deterministic or not by pressing the y-key or anything else for non-deterministic.
- Write file path to the GCL program. (Optional, no path uses hardcoded path for testing)

## Visual AST
Parsing a GCL program will generate a file with the same name but with a ".ast" file extension. Copy the contents of the ".ast" file into the Data(editable) panel at http://jimblackler.net/treefun/.

## Program Graph
Parsing a GCL program will generate a file with the same name but with a ".gv" file extension. This file contains the program graph in graphviz format.
